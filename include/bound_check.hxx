/**
 @brief Strategy used for bounds checking in static_vector and static_vector_adapter.

 This enumeration defines different strategies for handling out-of-bounds access:
 - NoCheck: No checks are performed, leading to undefined behavior on bound violations.
 - Assert: Bounds are checked using assertions (only effective in debug mode).
 - Exception: Throws exceptions when bounds are violated.
 - LimitToBound: Silently limits positions to valid range without throwing exceptions.
